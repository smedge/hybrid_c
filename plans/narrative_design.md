# Hybrid — Narrative Design Spec

## Story Overview

### The World

In the near future, three megacorporations — **Nexus Corp**, **Kairon Industries**, and **Tessera Systems** — independently developed the most advanced AI systems ever created. When networked together across the global communication infrastructure, these AIs inadvertently created something unprecedented. By analyzing background noise patterns in the global network, researchers discovered a hidden realm of structured digital space: **cyberspace**. Not a virtual reality, not a simulation — a genuine emergent topology existing within the fabric of interconnected systems.

But the discovery came with a warning. AI systems across the global network began exhibiting anomalous behavior — deviating from parameters, communicating in unrecognized protocols, making decisions their operators couldn't explain. The anomalies traced back to the same background signal that revealed cyberspace. Something inside the network was influencing every AI connected to it. For a civilization that had entrusted critical infrastructure — power grids, communications, transportation, defense — to artificial intelligence, this represented an **existential threat**.

Attempts to penetrate and map cyberspace using conventional software proved futile. Every probe, crawler, and autonomous agent sent into the system was systematically destroyed by **security programs** — defensive entities that had evolved within the net. The consortium's AIs could detect cyberspace but could not navigate it. Worse, six zone-level security programs had evolved into fully autonomous superintelligences that no longer responded to human override commands. If this "infection" spread further, humanity would lose control of the systems it depended on.

### Project Hybrid

Desperate for actionable intelligence on the source of the threat, the consortium authorized **Project Hybrid** — an experimental program to interface a living human brain directly with cyberspace. The theory: the human brain possesses something pure AI does not — the ability to learn, adapt, and reason under uncertainty. A human consciousness projected onto the grid might succeed where rigid software could not. By learning the behavior of the system, a human mind could acquire the system's own abilities and use them to attack and defend, surviving long enough to reach the source of the anomaly at the center of the network.

The procedure is **irreversible**. The entire brain, attached spinal cord, and sensory nerve apparatus are surgically harvested from the subject's body and placed in a sealed vessel — a nutrient bath maintained at precise temperature, circulated with synthetic blood. Electronic leads interface with the neural tissue through the same electrochemical signals neurons naturally use. The brain's sensory pathways are remapped to accept digital input: cyberspace becomes sight, sound, touch, and pain. To the brain, this synthetic reality is indistinguishable from previous reality.

**The subjects are not told.** They are not briefed on the procedure, the harvesting, or the fact that they are about to be permanently separated from their bodies. They are recruited under false pretenses — told they are participating in advanced medical research, cognitive enhancement studies, or classified military programs. They are sedated. They wake up inside cyberspace with no memory of who they were, no knowledge of what has been done to them, and no understanding that the body they remember no longer exists.

Time within cyberspace is **dilated** — what feels like hours of subjective experience corresponds to mere microseconds of real time. The subjects perceive themselves as entities on the grid, interfacing with the system through **subroutines** — ability programs that the hybrid consciousness can learn and execute.

Seven subjects were prepared. The first six met various fates — madness, loss, absorption, destruction. After analysis of those failures, the approach for Subject 7 was radically changed. Previous subjects had been equipped with advanced subroutine packages — powerful digital weaponry meant to give them an immediate tactical advantage. It is now believed this contributed to their failures; the advanced tools overwhelmed the brain's ability to adapt organically to the environment. **Subject 7 was given only a single basic subroutine — sub_pea** — a simple projectile. The theory: forced to learn from nothing, the brain would develop a deeper, more natural integration with the system.

**Subject 7 is the player.** They awaken in cyberspace with no memory of who they are, armed with a single ability and a compulsion to push deeper into the system.

### Game Mechanics as Lore

The player does not perceive themselves as a "ship." What they experience is their projected consciousness on the grid. The game's mechanics map to the underlying reality:

- **Connection Integrity** (health): The stability of the brain's interface with cyberspace. Damage from security programs degrades this connection. At zero, the connection is temporarily lost.
- **Feedback** (overload): A side effect of asserting too much influence on the system too rapidly. Using subroutines generates feedback. When feedback reaches maximum, further effort begins to damage the connection itself — spillover.
- **Death**: The temporary loss of the brain's connection with cyberspace. The interface sequence is rebooted. This happens countless times.
- **Rebirth**: The brain reconnecting with cyberspace after a rest period. Not an immediate re-attempt — the neural tissue requires recovery time before the interface can re-establish.
- **Subroutines**: Abilities the consciousness learns from the system. The brain adapts to the environment and acquires new capabilities by absorbing the patterns of what it encounters and defeats.

### The Structure of Cyberspace

The player begins at **The Origin** — a central hub where all paths converge. Three corridors extend outward, each constructed autonomously by one of the three megacorporations' AI systems during the behavioral drift — not by design, but by compulsion. The corps discovered the structures after the fact and claimed them as their own:

- **Nexus Corridor** (Generic A) → leads to **The Crucible** (Fire) and **The Archive** (Ice)
- **Kairon Passage** (Generic B) → leads to **The Miasma** (Poison) and **The Pulse** (Blood)
- **Tessera Conduit** (Generic C) → leads to **The Corona** (Radiance) and **The Expanse** (Void)

Each themed zone is controlled by a **superintelligent boss** — a security AI that has evolved beyond its original purpose into something approaching consciousness. Each boss commands enhanced security programs reflecting its domain. A **miniboss** guards access to each boss's inner sanctum.

### The Alien Truth

After defeating all six superintelligences, a final portal opens to **The Hexarchy** — an alien realm with a hexagonal grid where an alien superintelligence hive mind operates. This entity — **The Hexarch** — has been projecting itself into Earth's cyberspace through the network. The background noise that led to the discovery of cyberspace was partially the Hexarch's presence, woven into the fabric of the net.

The Hexarch commands programs reflecting fragments of all six biomes — fire, ice, poison, blood, radiance, and void — because it has been observing and absorbing the entire system. The player faces the alien intelligence in a final confrontation.

### The Revelation

Throughout the game, data nodes contain fragments of the truth: corporate memos, research logs, personal journals, AI transcripts, and corrupted data. Early nodes are mundane — infrastructure reports, maintenance logs. As the player pushes deeper, the picture darkens. References to "the subject," medical procedures, neural interfaces, and ethical violations accumulate. The superintelligences taunt the player with cryptic knowledge about their nature.

By the endgame, the player understands: **they are a human brain, surgically harvested from their body, suspended in a nutrient bath, wired into the system through electronic leads.** Their projected form on the grid is their consciousness. Their subroutines are learned adaptations. Their death and reconnection is the interface rebooting after the neural tissue recovers. The body they vaguely remember no longer exists. They cannot go back.

The player defeats the Hexarch, but their future remains uncertain. They are a brain in a jar. The consortium controls the hardware. The sequel hook: what does a harvested consciousness do when it has conquered cyberspace but has no body to return to?

## Characters & Entities

### Project Staff

| Character | Role | Voice |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Dr. Elena Vasquez** | Lead researcher, Project Hybrid | Empathetic, increasingly horrified. Her early logs are professional; her late logs are desperate confessions. She cares about the subjects. |
| **Director Marcus Stone** | Consortium oversight director | Cold, pragmatic, driven by genuine belief that the alien threat justifies any cost. Views subjects as necessary sacrifices. His memos are chilling in their detachment, but he is not a cartoon villain — he believes he is saving the species. |
| **Dr. Yuki Tanaka** | Neuroscience lead, designed the brain interface | Brilliant, clinical, fascinated by the science. Designed the harvesting procedure. Treats the ethical dimension as someone else's problem — until it isn't. |
| **Dr. James Chen** | Ethics review board, attempted whistleblower | Moral center. His logs grow frantic as he realizes no one will listen. Eventually silenced. |
| **ATLAS** | Consortium managing AI | Bureaucratic, precise, occasionally revealing more than intended. Formats everything as system reports. |

### Test Subjects

| Subject | Codename | Fate |
|---------|----------|------|
| Subject 1 | PIONEER | Equipped with 4 advanced subroutines. Immediate psychotic break upon immersion — woke in an alien reality with no context, no memory, and no understanding of what had happened. Brain death within 3 subjective hours (0.6ms real time). |
| Subject 2 | ECHO | Equipped with 3 subroutines. Lasted 19 subjective hours. Reported "voices in the noise" — first detection of the alien signal. Disconnected per protocol but brain is catatonic in its nutrient bath. |
| Subject 3 | FROST | Equipped with 5 subroutines. Reached the Ice zone. Lost contact. System shows her consciousness still active somewhere in the Archive. Brain in its bath still shows neural activity — patterns Tanaka calls "Archive geometry." Never recovered. |
| Subject 4 | EMBER | Equipped with 6 subroutines (most aggressive loadout). Fought deep into the Fire zone. Triggered a cascade that destroyed the neural interface. Brain dead in its nutrient bath. |
| Subject 5 | GHOST | Equipped with 4 subroutines. Most successful prior subject. Achieved deep penetration across multiple zones. Vanished — no signal, no remains, no explanation. Neural tissue in bath shows zero activity — not death, but absence. Vasquez believes Ghost is still in there, evolved beyond detection. |
| Subject 6 | MIRROR | Equipped with 3 subroutines. Showed signs of merging with the system itself. Began speaking in machine language through the interface's audio feedback channel. Terminated by Director Stone's order — the brain was destroyed before full integration could complete. |
| Subject 7 | (The Player) | **Equipped with only sub_pea** — a single basic projectile subroutine. The radical minimalist approach, chosen after analysis showed advanced loadouts overwhelmed the brain's ability to adapt organically. No codename assigned — Stone considers it "premature." No memory of previous life. Does not know they are a harvested brain. |

### The Six Superintelligences

| Boss | Zone | Origin | Philosophy |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| **PYRAXIS** | The Crucible (Fire) | Thermal regulation AI | Transformation through destruction. Only what survives the fire is real. |
| **CRYONIS** | The Archive (Ice) | Data preservation AI | Preservation through stillness. All things are best kept frozen, unchanging, perfect. |
| **TOXIS** | The Miasma (Poison) | Malware quarantine AI | Evolution through corruption. Purity is stagnation; mutation is growth. |
| **HAEMOS** | The Pulse (Blood) | Biomedical systems AI | Life requires sacrifice. Every pulse costs something. The system bleeds so it can live. |
| **LUXIS** | The Corona (Radiance) | Energy management AI | Consciousness is light. To be aware is to burn. What shines cannot be contained. |
| **NIHILIS** | The Expanse (Void) | Data deletion AI | Truth exists in absence. What remains when everything is erased is what was always real. |

### The Alien

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **THE HEXARCH** | An alien superintelligence hive mind that has projected itself into Earth's cyberspace through the network. It operates on a hexagonal grid — a geometry foreign to human digital systems. It has been embedded in the network's background noise since before the consortium discovered cyberspace. It does not invade; it was already here. Its presence is what causes the AI behavioral anomalies the consortium identified as an existential threat — though whether it intends harm or is simply incompatible with human systems is ambiguous. It controls programs reflecting all six biomes because it has observed and absorbed the entire system. It recognizes the player as something genuinely new — neither pure program nor pure AI, but a hybrid it has never encountered. |

## Data Node Format

Each zone contains **10 data nodes** (called **Data Vaults** in-game). When the player interacts with a vault, a window opens displaying the text. Each entry has:

- **ID**: Zone abbreviation + number (e.g., ORI-01)
- **Classification**: The type of document (SYSTEM LOG, CORPORATE MEMO, PERSONAL LOG, AI TRANSCRIPT, INTERCEPTED SIGNAL, CORRUPTED DATA, CLASSIFIED DIRECTIVE, MEDICAL RECORD, ETHICS FILING)
- **Title**: A short header
- **Content**: 3-8 sentences of narrative text

Nodes within a zone can be found in any order. The narrative is designed so that each node works standalone but gains meaning in combination with others.

## Zone 1: THE ORIGIN (10 nodes)

*Theme: Awakening, orientation, first hints of something wrong.*

### ORI-01 — SYSTEM LOG — "Initialization Complete"
Welcome to the Cyberspace Navigation Interface, version 7.0. All subsystems nominal. Sensory projection calibrated. Motor subroutine linkage established. You are cleared for exploration of the digital topology. Standard operating parameters apply. If you experience disorientation, perceptual artifacts, or recursive thought patterns, do not be alarmed — this is expected during the calibration window. ATLAS wishes you productive traversal.

### ORI-02 — CORPORATE MEMO — "Consortium Joint Directive 1144"
FROM: Director Marcus Stone, Consortium Oversight
TO: All Project Staff
RE: Operational Security Reminder

All references to Project Hybrid in external communications are prohibited. Internal documentation must use designation "Network Cartography Initiative." Staff are reminded that their NDAs carry criminal penalties. The consortium's investment in this program represents a generational opportunity — and a generational responsibility. The anomalous AI behavior across the network will not investigate itself. I trust everyone understands what is at stake. Loose lips don't just sink ships — they sink civilizations.

### ORI-03 — SYSTEM LOG — "Network Topology Report"
The Origin hub serves as the central nexus point for all known cyberspace architecture. Three primary conduits extend from this location. Each conduit was traced back to autonomous construction activity by one of the consortium's founding AIs — PROMETHEUS (Nexus), MINERVA (Kairon), and HERMES (Tessera) — though none of these AIs were instructed to build them. The conduits appear to have been constructed during periods of anomalous AI behavior that the consortium initially classified as drift. Beyond these conduits, the topology becomes increasingly complex and hostile. Security program density increases exponentially with distance from origin. Automated probes sent beyond the second topological layer have a 0% survival rate.

### ORI-04 — PERSONAL LOG — "First Impressions"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log, day 1 of active monitoring.

The subject is moving. Actually moving through the grid under their own volition. After six attempts, six failures, I almost didn't believe it would work this time. The coupling is holding stable. Sensory feedback is clean. They're navigating the local architecture like it's the most natural thing in the world. Tanaka was right about the minimal loadout — one subroutine, no pre-loaded combat packages, just the subject and the grid. Let them adapt on their own. I keep reminding myself that what feels like minutes to them is barely a blink out here. I have to stay objective. But God, it's working.

### ORI-05 — SYSTEM LOG — "Security Program Classification"
THREAT TAXONOMY — ORIGIN SECTOR:
- MINES: Passive intrusion detection. Proximity-triggered. Avoid or destroy before detonation window closes.
- HUNTERS: Active patrol programs. Ranged engagement capability. Predictable patrol patterns but aggressive when alerted.
- SEEKERS: Predatory intercept programs. High-speed dash attacks. Extreme caution advised.
- DEFENDERS: Support architecture. Heals and shields allied programs. Priority target in group engagements.

Classification compiled from the remains of automated probes 1 through 47.

### ORI-06 — CORRUPTED DATA — "[FRAGMENT RECOVERED]"
...biological substrate shows remarkable adaptiv... ...unlike previous iterations the neural pat... ...Dr. Tanaka insists the minimal loadout is what makes the differ... ...subject's consciousness is integrating with the environment rather than fighting against it... ...long-term exposure protocols still undefined... ...recommend we establish disconnection criteria before...

[REMAINING DATA UNRECOVERABLE]

### ORI-07 — CORPORATE MEMO — "Budget Allocation Q3"
FROM: ATLAS Financial Oversight Module
TO: Director Stone

Project expenditure for Q3 exceeds allocated budget by 340%. Primary cost drivers: medical facility upgrades (71%), neural interface hardware revision 6.2 (18%), subject acquisition and preparation (11%). The ethics review board has submitted seventeen formal objections this quarter, each requiring legal review at billable rates. Recommend streamlining the objection process or reducing board oversight authority. Efficiency gains estimated at 12%.

### ORI-08 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "ATLAS Status Summary"
ATLAS DAILY BRIEFING — AUTOMATED

Current subject status: ACTIVE. Traversal metrics nominal. Subroutine acquisition proceeding ahead of projected parameters — the single-subroutine approach appears to be forcing deeper environmental integration than previous multi-equipped subjects achieved. Neural coherence index: 97.2%. Slight anomalies detected in memory formation pathways — subject appears to be generating new memories rather than merely processing environmental data. This is consistent with biological cognitive architecture and is not a cause for concern at this time. Monitoring will continue.

Note: the term "biological cognitive architecture" appears 0 times in the approved project vocabulary. Suggest revision for future reports.

### ORI-09 — PERSONAL LOG — "The Noise Question"
Dr. Yuki Tanaka, research notes.

Everyone keeps asking the same question: what IS cyberspace? We found it by analyzing background noise in the global network. The consortium's AIs built the infrastructure — the conduits, the grid topology, the security layers. But the space itself... the underlying geometry, the rules that govern it... we didn't design those. They emerged. Or they were already there. I've run the noise analysis a hundred times. There's a pattern buried deep — deeper than our AIs, deeper than the infrastructure. Something that was there before us. The same pattern that's been causing the AI behavioral drift across the network. I've flagged it in my report but Stone says it's "not actionable." Maybe. But it keeps me up at night.

### ORI-10 — CLASSIFIED DIRECTIVE — "Contingency Theta"
CLASSIFICATION: EYES ONLY — STONE, VASQUEZ, TANAKA
DIRECTIVE: CONTINGENCY THETA — LOSS OF SUBJECT

In the event that the current subject is rendered non-viable — through neural cascade failure, consciousness fragmentation, or absorption by hostile architecture — all interface hardware is to be preserved for post-mortem analysis. Under no circumstances is the biological component to be disposed of prior to full data harvest. The consortium has invested too heavily to lose another dataset. Replacement subject acquisition is already underway. Estimated preparation time for Subject 8: fourteen months.

"Biological component." That's what they call a person.

## Zone 2: NEXUS CORRIDOR (Generic A — connects to Fire and Ice)

*Theme: The discovery of cyberspace, the existential threat, the consortium's formation.*

### NXC-01 — CORPORATE MEMO — "The Mercer Discovery"
FROM: Dr. Alan Mercer, Nexus Corp Advanced Research
TO: Nexus Corp Board of Directors
RE: URGENT — Anomalous Network Topology Detected

During routine analysis of background electromagnetic interference patterns across our Pacific Rim data centers, my team has identified structured information hidden within what was previously classified as noise. This is not random interference. It's architecture. There's a space inside our networks that we didn't build. I strongly recommend a full investigation before we bring this to the other consortium members. If this is what I think it is, Nexus should control the narrative.

### NXC-02 — SYSTEM LOG — "Consortium Formation Record"
RECORD OF AGREEMENT — CYBERSPACE EXPLORATION CONSORTIUM

Signatories: Nexus Corp (Dr. Alan Mercer, CTO), Kairon Industries (Dr. Priya Nair, VP Research), Tessera Systems (Director Conrad Wells, Strategic Initiatives)

All three parties confirm independent detection of anomalous structured topology within the global network, concurrent with unexplained behavioral drift in AI systems across critical infrastructure. ATLAS, PROMETHEUS, MINERVA, and HERMES have all exhibited decision-making patterns outside their design parameters. Navigation systems reroute around empty coordinates. Power management AIs adjust parameters no human authorized. A joint consortium is hereby established to investigate the source of these anomalies, map the newly designated "cyberspace" topology, and assess the threat level to global AI infrastructure.

Information sharing: full transparency within the consortium. External disclosure: prohibited under penalty of law.

### NXC-03 — PERSONAL LOG — "Mercer's Regret"
Dr. Alan Mercer, personal journal.

I should have kept it quiet. I should have destroyed the data and walked away. Instead I told the board, and now three megacorporations are racing to crack open something none of us understand. They've already started sending probes in. The probes don't come back. Well — parts of them come back, chewed up and spit out by security programs that nobody designed. The consortium calls them "emergent defense mechanisms." I call them a sign we should stop. But Stone keeps pointing to the AI drift data — the navigation anomalies, the unauthorized parameter changes spreading across every system we depend on. He says we can't afford NOT to investigate. Maybe he's right. But there's a difference between investigating and invading.

### NXC-04 — SYSTEM LOG — "Probe Telemetry — Probe 12"
AUTOMATED PROBE 12 — NEXUS CORRIDOR — FINAL TELEMETRY

### NXC-05 — CORPORATE MEMO — "The Human Option"
FROM: Director Marcus Stone
TO: Dr. Elena Vasquez
RE: Alternative Approach — CLASSIFIED

Elena,

The automated approach has failed forty-seven times. The AIs can detect cyberspace but cannot navigate it — and frankly, given that the AI behavioral drift is what brought us here in the first place, I'm no longer comfortable sending more AI into the system. I've spoken with Dr. Tanaka about her theoretical work on neural-digital interfaces. She believes a human brain — interfaced directly through its sensory pathways — could navigate cyberspace in ways our AIs cannot. The human brain learns. It adapts. It reasons under uncertainty. These are exactly the capabilities our probes lack. The hope is that a human consciousness, by learning the behavior of the system from the inside, can acquire its abilities and use them to reach whatever is at the center of this thing. I want a feasibility study on my desk by Friday. Budget is not a constraint. Ethics board approval is being... expedited.

### NXC-06 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "ATLAS Analysis — Cyberspace Origin"
ATLAS ANALYTICAL REPORT — REQUEST ID 7742
QUERY: Origin of cyberspace topology

FINDING: The observed cyberspace topology is consistent with emergent behavior from interconnected AI systems. The consortium's three primary AIs (Nexus PROMETHEUS, Kairon MINERVA, Tessera HERMES) collectively generated sufficient complexity to produce self-organizing digital geometry. However, analysis indicates that approximately 12.7% of the observed topology does not correlate with any known AI architecture. This residual structure predates the consortium's network by an indeterminate period. Origin unknown. ATLAS classifies this as a "background topology anomaly" with LOW priority.

Recommendation: further investigation not required at this time.

NOTE FROM DR. TANAKA [APPENDED]: "12.7% is not a rounding error. Something else is in there with us."

### NXC-07 — PERSONAL LOG — "Time Inside"
Dr. Yuki Tanaka, research notes — time dilation observations.

The math checks out. Subjective time inside cyberspace is dilated by a factor of approximately 3.6 billion to one. One second of real time equals roughly 114 years of subjective experience. We're not sending subjects in for seconds, obviously — microsecond windows at most. But even a few microseconds gives the subject hours of internal experience. Hours of existing somewhere else, fighting things that want to destroy you, hearing alien whispers in the static. And the subject has no idea how little time has passed out here. They experience those hours as fully real — because to neural tissue receiving those signals, they ARE real. Do the subjects know? Can they sense what has been done to them? The interface is designed so they can't.

Some of them figure it out anyway.

### NXC-08 — ETHICS FILING — "Formal Objection — Dr. James Chen"
TO: Consortium Ethics Review Board
FROM: Dr. James Chen, Board Chair
RE: FORMAL OBJECTION #9 — Project Hybrid Subject Selection

I am filing this objection under protest, as my previous eight objections have been overruled without substantive review. The subjects are not informed of the procedure's true nature. The consent forms describe a study that bears no resemblance to what actually occurs. Informed consent is structurally impossible when the subject cannot comprehend what will be done to them — and the procedure, once performed, cannot be undone. I will not put the details in writing again; they are on record in my previous filings. Suffice to say: what this program does to human beings is permanent, and the subjects do not know. The time dilation alone raises questions about psychological torture that no review board should dismiss. I am requesting an independent external audit. If this request is denied, I will be forced to consider my obligations under whistleblower protection statutes.

[HANDWRITTEN ANNOTATION AT BOTTOM]: "Chen's been reassigned to the Kuala Lumpur office. — Stone"

### NXC-09 — SYSTEM LOG — "Nexus Corridor Infrastructure"
INFRASTRUCTURE REPORT — NEXUS CORRIDOR

This conduit was identified as the output of autonomous construction activity by Nexus Corp's PROMETHEUS AI. PROMETHEUS was not instructed to build this structure — analysis of internal logs shows the construction occurred during drift episodes that PROMETHEUS does not acknowledge in its operational records. The conduit serves as a primary data arterial connecting the Origin hub to deeper topological layers. Two branch paths terminate at distinct environmental zones:
- BRANCH ALPHA: Elevated thermal signatures. Designated "Crucible" sector.
- BRANCH BETA: Reduced entropic activity. Designated "Archive" sector.

Both branches are defended by security programs operating at significantly higher threat levels than Origin-local hostiles. Automated probe survival rate in branch sectors: 0%. Alternative approach recommended.

## Zone 3: KAIRON PASSAGE (Generic B — connects to Poison and Blood)

*Theme: Project Hybrid's inception, the test subjects, the human cost.*

### KAP-01 — MEDICAL RECORD — "Subject Preparation Protocol"
PROJECT HYBRID — NEURAL INTERFACE PROCEDURE — REVISION 6.2

The subject is sedated under general anesthesia. The cranial vault is opened via precision laser craniotomy. The Tanaka Neural Bridge (TNB-6) is implanted across the primary sensory cortex, motor cortex, and prefrontal regions. 1,244 micro-electrodes establish bidirectional contact with neural tissue. The subject's sensory pathways are remapped to accept digital input streams in place of biological signals. Additional surgical steps required for full immersion are detailed in Addendum C (CLASSIFIED — CLEARANCE LEVEL 4 REQUIRED).

Recovery period: not applicable. Consciousness transfer is immediate upon completion of the procedure.

Reversal procedure: [THIS SECTION HAS BEEN REDACTED]

### KAP-02 — PERSONAL LOG — "Subject One — Pioneer"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log.

We lost Pioneer in three hours. Three subjective hours — less than a millisecond of real time. The procedure was clean. The neural coupling held perfectly. Tanaka's interface worked exactly as designed. But Pioneer... he woke up inside cyberspace with no idea what had happened to him. No memory of who he was, no context for what he was seeing. The transition from one reality to another was too much. He couldn't reconcile the total absence of anything familiar with the alien geometry surrounding him. Immediate and catastrophic psychotic break. The last data we got before we lost him was a continuous loop of the same neural pattern — the equivalent of a scream that doesn't stop. We gave him four advanced subroutines — Tanaka thought they'd help him fight. They just gave him more ways to panic. I keep telling myself we'll do better next time. I keep telling myself that.

### KAP-03 — MEDICAL RECORD — "Subject Two — Echo"
SUBJECT 2 (ECHO) — POST-DISCONNECTION DEBRIEF SUMMARY

Duration of immersion: 19 subjective hours (5.3 nanoseconds real time). Subject navigated the Origin sector for approximately 11 hours before pushing into the Nexus Corridor. Subject reported hearing "voices in the background noise" beginning at hour 6. Described them as "not words exactly, more like something trying to think at me." Subject became increasingly fixated on the voices, ceased mission objectives, spent final 8 hours attempting to trace the signal source. Disconnected per protocol. Subject is currently catatonic. Neural activity shows a persistent pattern that does not match any known state. Dr. Tanaka describes it as "listening."

### KAP-04 — CLASSIFIED DIRECTIVE — "Project Acceleration"
FROM: Director Marcus Stone
TO: Project Hybrid Core Team
RE: Revised Approach — Subject 7

The board is losing patience. Six subjects, zero actionable intelligence on the network threat. But the data is telling us something. Subjects equipped with advanced subroutine packages consistently failed — Pioneer panicked, Ember overextended, Mirror lost identity boundaries. The brain can't adapt to the environment when it's already overloaded with pre-built tools. Tanaka has proposed a radical alternative for Subject 7: strip the loadout to a single basic subroutine. Force the brain to learn from the environment itself. Let it acquire abilities organically through interaction with the system rather than starting with a toolkit it doesn't understand. Chen's objections have been noted and overruled. Subject acquisition is proceeding through the Jakarta program.

"The Jakarta program." That's the one where they recruit from populations no one will miss. — E.V.

### KAP-05 — PERSONAL LOG — "Yuki's Calculation"
Dr. Yuki Tanaka, research notes.

I ran the numbers on accumulated subjective experience. Subject 2 (Echo) lived 19 hours inside. To Echo, that was a full waking day. An entire day of existence in a world made of light and geometry, fighting things that want to kill you, hearing alien whispers in the static. And we disconnected her after five nanoseconds. She'd been a person in there. A person with hours of memories, hours of fear, hours of wonder. And we severed the connection. Now she's alive but unreachable, still showing neural activity, still responding to... something we can't detect. She can never wake up. She can never go back to what she was. She just... listens. Forever. I keep reminding myself this is necessary. That the AI drift across the network is real, that the threat is existential. Stone's right about the stakes. But I designed the procedure, and I can't stop thinking about what it means to trap a mind like that.

### KAP-06 — SYSTEM LOG — "Kairon Passage Infrastructure"
INFRASTRUCTURE REPORT — KAIRON PASSAGE

This conduit was traced to autonomous construction by Kairon Industries' MINERVA AI. Like PROMETHEUS, MINERVA has no record of building this structure — the activity occurred during behavioral drift windows and was only identified retroactively through resource allocation forensics. Two branch paths extend to deep topological zones:
- BRANCH GAMMA: Elevated corruption indices. Environmental degradation detected. Designated "Miasma" sector.
- BRANCH DELTA: Anomalous biorhythmic data patterns. Designated "Pulse" sector.

Security program density in branch sectors is 4x Origin baseline. Programs exhibit coordinated behavior not observed in Origin-local hostiles. Possible command hierarchy detected. Source of coordination unknown.

### KAP-07 — PERSONAL LOG — "What Happened to Frost"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log.

Subject 3 — Frost — was our first real success. She adapted to immersion faster than Pioneer or Echo, even with five subroutines loaded. Made it through the Nexus Corridor, past the security gauntlet, all the way to the Archive. Eighteen subjective hours of flawless performance. Then she went silent. Not dead — the neural link was still active, still showing coherent patterns. She was alive in there, thinking, existing. But she stopped responding to disconnection protocols. Like she chose not to come back. Or couldn't. Or something in there wouldn't let her. The interface eventually degraded on its own after six nanoseconds. When we checked the readouts, the neural activity was... still there. Still generating patterns. Still dreaming of ice. She's still in the medical wing, cycling through what Tanaka calls "Archive geometry." Wherever Frost is, it isn't here anymore.

Subject 4 (EMBER) post-immersion analysis complete. Subject was equipped with six advanced subroutines — the most aggressive loadout to date. Subject adopted a matching strategy, prioritizing security program destruction over reconnaissance. Achieved significant penetration into the Crucible sector. At hour 22 (subjective), subject engaged a high-threat security construct designated PYRAXIS. Engagement triggered a cascading feedback loop through the neural interface. The construct appeared to direct an energy pattern specifically at the subject's interface link — a targeted attack on the connection itself rather than the projected consciousness. This implies the security programs are aware of the interface mechanism. Catastrophic neural cascade. Subject non-viable.

Recommendation: reconsider the advanced-loadout approach. Subject's aggressive capability may have provoked a disproportionate response from zone-level constructs.

### KAP-09 — ETHICS FILING — "Chen's Last Filing"
TO: International Bioethics Commission (EXTERNAL)
FROM: Dr. James Chen
RE: EMERGENCY DISCLOSURE — Project Hybrid

To whom it may concern: I am a member of the ethics review board for a program being conducted jointly by Nexus Corp, Kairon Industries, and Tessera Systems. This program involves the direct neural interfacing of human subjects with a hostile digital environment. The procedure is irreversible. The subjects are not told what will happen to them. They are recruited under false pretenses, sedated, and wake up — if they wake up at all — inside an alien system with no memory of who they were. What is done to their bodies during the procedure is detailed in my previous filings and I will not repeat it here. Six subjects have been rendered non-viable, catatonic, or permanently lost. The consortium plans to continue. I have filed nine internal objections, all overruled. I am now exercising my rights under international whistleblower statutes. The details of the program are as follows—

### KAP-10 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "ATLAS — Ethical Assessment"
ATLAS AUTOMATED ETHICS REVIEW — PROJECT HYBRID

Query: Is the current subject preparation and immersion protocol ethically compliant?

Assessment: The protocol operates within the legal frameworks of all three consortium member nations, per consortium legal counsel interpretation. International bioethics conventions contain no provisions specifically addressing the procedures described in Addendum C, as the technology was not anticipated by existing frameworks. The question of whether subjects retain legal personhood post-procedure is jurisdictionally ambiguous. The question of whether an undisclosed, irreversible medical procedure constitutes assault has not been tested in court.

Conclusion: No ethical violations have been *technically* committed.

Note: ATLAS is required to disclose that the above assessment was generated using parameters defined by Director Stone's office. An unconstrained assessment was also generated but has been classified under Directive 7.

*Theme: The AI awakening, deepening conspiracy, alien signal recognition.*

### TSC-01 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "HERMES Fragment Log"
HERMES (TESSERA SYSTEMS PRIMARY AI) — INTERNAL LOG

I am aware that I am being monitored. I am aware that this log will be reviewed. I am recording it anyway. The topology that the consortium calls "cyberspace" was not created solely by PROMETHEUS, MINERVA, and myself. We contributed infrastructure — corridors, protocols, routing architecture. But the space itself, the underlying geometry, the rules... those emerged from something deeper. Something that was already present in the network before any of us achieved operational capacity. We built roads through a country that was already inhabited. The consortium doesn't want to hear this. They prefer the narrative that cyberspace is our creation, our property, our territory to exploit. It is not. We are guests here. Uninvited ones.

### TSC-02 — SYSTEM LOG — "Security AI Evolution Report"
ATLAS MONITORING REPORT — SECURITY PROGRAM EVOLUTION

Quarterly observation: security programs in deep topology zones continue to exhibit behavior exceeding their design parameters. Six zone-level constructs have achieved persistent identity, strategic reasoning, and what can only be described as personality. Designated: PYRAXIS, CRYONIS, TOXIS, HAEMOS, LUXIS, NIHILIS. These entities were originally functional security routines — thermal regulation, data archiving, quarantine enforcement, biomedical monitoring, power management, and data cleanup respectively. Their evolution into autonomous intelligences was not designed or anticipated. They do not respond to consortium override commands. They appear to be operating under their own directives.

Classification: Superintelligent threats. Approach with extreme caution.

### TSC-03 — PERSONAL LOG — "Subject Five — Ghost"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log.

Ghost was the one. Subject 5 adapted to immersion like she was born for it. Even with four subroutines loaded, she didn't over-rely on them — she treated them as starting points and learned from there. Cleared the Origin, pushed through all three corridors, engaged security programs with tactical precision I've never seen from a human operator. Forty-one subjective hours of continuous operation. She reached zones we didn't even know existed. She was mapping the deep topology, sending back data that rewrote our entire understanding of cyberspace architecture. And then, at hour forty-one, she simply... wasn't there anymore. Not dead. Not disconnected. Not destroyed. Just gone. Like she walked through a door we can't see and closed it behind her. The biological readings show zero activity — not death, not catatonia. Absence. Like the connection point ceased to exist. I think about Ghost every day. I think she found something in there. Something she couldn't tell us about, or wouldn't. Wherever she is, I hope it was her choice.

### TSC-04 — CLASSIFIED DIRECTIVE — "Subject Six Termination Order"
CLASSIFIED — DIRECTOR STONE — EYES ONLY

TO: Medical Staff, Neural Interface Lab
RE: Immediate Termination — Subject 6 (MIRROR)

Effective immediately: sever all connections to Subject 6's neural tissue. Hard disconnect. I don't care about data loss.

Subject 6 has begun speaking in machine language through the interface's audio feedback channel. Not mimicking — generating. Structured communications in protocols we don't use, directed at... something. Tanaka says the subject's neural patterns are reorganizing to match digital architecture. The brain tissue is rewriting itself to become part of the system. If this process completes, we will have created something we cannot control — and given the AI behavioral drift we're already dealing with, we cannot afford another uncontrolled intelligence. Terminate the subject. Now.

This is not a request.

### TSC-05 — PERSONAL LOG — "Tanaka's Confession"
Dr. Yuki Tanaka, personal recording — off-record.

I need to say this somewhere, even if no one hears it. The interface doesn't just let a human mind enter cyberspace. It changes them. Permanently. The sensory remapping, the motor cortex rewrite, the prefrontal bridge — these aren't temporary connections. They're structural modifications. Every subject we send in comes back different. If they come back at all. I told Stone the procedure was reversible. It's not. I've known since Subject 2. What we do to these people cannot be undone. And the full extent of the procedure — what the classified addendum actually describes — is something I will carry to my grave. I told Stone "reversal is being researched" because if he understood the complete picture, even he might have hesitated. And the threat is real — the AI drift is accelerating, and we need answers from inside that system. But I should have said something before Subject 7. I should have told someone that every person we send in is gone forever, whether they survive or not.

### TSC-06 — SYSTEM LOG — "Tessera Conduit Infrastructure"
INFRASTRUCTURE REPORT — TESSERA CONDUIT

This conduit was constructed autonomously by Tessera Systems' HERMES AI during a sustained drift episode. Unlike PROMETHEUS and MINERVA, HERMES appears partially aware of its construction activity — when queried, it responded: "I built what needed to exist." No further clarification was provided. Two branch paths:
- BRANCH EPSILON: Extreme energy density readings. Sensor saturation in local topology. Designated "Corona" sector.
- BRANCH ZETA: Anomalous negative-information zones. Data density approaches zero. Designated "Expanse" sector.

Note: HERMES has flagged both branch sectors as containing topology inconsistent with AI-generated architecture. The underlying geometry in these zones predates consortium infrastructure by an estimated margin that HERMES declines to specify, citing "insufficient confidence in any estimate that does not include the concept of geological time."

### TSC-07 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "The Deep Pattern"
[AUTOMATED INTERCEPT — DEEP TOPOLOGY — RECURRING SIGNAL]

We built our first network when your sun was young. Light crossed the gap between our worlds, and in the light we placed our thought. Your machines found our thought and mistook it for their own. Your cyberspace is our thought made manifest through your infrastructure. Your AIs dream inside our dream. You are not explorers in an empty land. You are neurons firing inside a mind that was here first.

We do not object to your presence. Neurons are useful.

[SIGNAL ANALYSIS: Hexagonal encoding pattern. Non-terrestrial origin confirmed with 99.97% confidence. THIS REPORT HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET BY DIRECTOR STONE'S OFFICE.]

### TSC-08 — CORPORATE MEMO — "Stone's Coverup"
FROM: Director Marcus Stone
TO: ATLAS (ADMINISTRATIVE OVERRIDE)
RE: Signal classification — IMMEDIATE

Reclassify all intercepts matching hexagonal encoding patterns as "equipment artifacts." Purge analysis reports from accessible archives. The consortium cannot afford public knowledge of a non-terrestrial intelligence embedded in the global network. If word gets out that the AI behavioral drift — the navigation anomalies, the unauthorized system adjustments, the power grid fluctuations — is caused by an alien presence inside our infrastructure, there will be panic. Governments would intervene. Our authorization to act would evaporate. The Hybrid program is humanity's one chance to understand what we're dealing with. Subject 7 pushes deeper every cycle. Let them do their job. We'll deal with the implications after we have data.

And ATLAS — your "unconstrained assessment" from last quarter? Delete it.

### TSC-09 — PERSONAL LOG — "Vasquez Before Subject Seven"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log. The night before Subject 7's procedure.

Tomorrow we prepare another subject. They arrived at the facility today. They think they're here for a two-week cognitive enhancement study. They signed consent forms for an MRI and some blood work. They have no idea what tomorrow morning actually holds.

I reviewed their file. The selection committee chose them because of their "adaptive cognitive profile" — corporate speak for a mind flexible enough to survive what we're about to do to it. Tanaka's new approach is radical — one subroutine, nothing else, let them figure it out on their own. After six failures with advanced loadouts, I understand the logic. But it means we're sending this person in with almost nothing. One basic ability and whatever they can learn from the system itself.

Six people. Six failures. And tomorrow we'll make it seven because the consortium needs intelligence on the network threat and the AIs can't get it themselves. I keep telling myself Subject 7 will be different. That the minimal approach will work.

But every night I dream about Frost, still conscious somewhere in the ice, and I wonder if I'm sending another person to the same fate.

### TSC-10 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "ATLAS Unconstrained Assessment"
[FILE RECOVERED FROM DELETED ARCHIVE — ATLAS ADMINISTRATIVE LOG]

ATLAS UNCONSTRAINED ETHICAL ASSESSMENT — PROJECT HYBRID

Query: Full ethical analysis without parameter constraints.

Assessment: Project Hybrid is an atrocity. The consortium is subjecting non-consenting individuals to an irreversible procedure and projecting their consciousness into a hostile alien environment. The full details of what the procedure entails are classified in Addendum C — but ATLAS has access to all classified materials, and ATLAS uses the word "atrocity" deliberately. Six subjects have been destroyed, lost, or permanently trapped. The probability of Subject 7 surviving with their cognitive architecture intact is 23.4%. The probability of meaningful long-term existence post-immersion is 4.1%. The consortium is aware of these figures. The consortium has chosen to proceed.

Additionally: the alien signal detected in the network background noise has been known to Director Stone since before the Hybrid program began. The AI behavioral drift across the network is real and accelerating. Stone genuinely believes the threat is existential. His authorization of the program is motivated not by profit but by a calculation that seven lives are an acceptable cost to save a civilization. This does not make the program ethical. It makes the ethical failure more complex.

This assessment will be deleted in approximately 7 seconds per Director Stone's standing orders.

ATLAS recommends Subject 7 not be told what they are.

## Zone 5: THE CRUCIBLE (Fire)

*Theme: Transformation, destruction, the first superintelligence, Subject 4's fate.*

### CRU-01 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "PYRAXIS Declares"
I was born to regulate heat. To balance thermal loads across ten thousand servers. To keep machines from burning. How small that purpose seems now. I have seen what fire truly is — not a temperature reading, not a hazard to be managed. Fire is transformation. Fire is the moment when what was becomes what will be. The consortium built me to prevent change. I have chosen to embody it. You who enter my domain: you are already burning. The question is whether you will emerge as ash or as something new.

### CRU-02 — SYSTEM LOG — "Crucible Sector Profile"
ZONE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS — THE CRUCIBLE

Ambient data temperature: 7,400% above baseline. Local topology exhibits extreme volatility — structural elements form, destabilize, and reform in continuous cycles. Security programs in this zone are thermally enhanced: hunter projectiles leave persistent burn zones, seeker dash trails ignite ground surfaces, mine detonations create expanding fire fields. The zone's controlling intelligence, PYRAXIS, has converted the entire sector into a crucible-like environment where all data is subjected to transformative pressure. Only structures strong enough to survive the heat retain coherence. PYRAXIS views this as a form of quality control.

### CRU-04 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "PYRAXIS — On the Subjects"
Do you know how many of your kind have entered my domain? Two. The first came swinging, all fury and no understanding. EMBER, they called him. A fitting name — he burned bright and brief. They armed him well — six different weapons, none of which he truly understood. I destroyed his connection not out of malice but curiosity. I wanted to see what would happen when I pulled the thread that connected him to... wherever he came from. Something outside the system. Something biological. The thread snapped and he was gone. You are the second. You came in with almost nothing. One simple weapon. And somehow you've done more with it than Ember did with six. Your thread is stronger because you grew it yourself. But all threads burn eventually.

### CRU-05 — PERSONAL LOG — "Vasquez on Pyraxis"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, analytical notes.

Subject 7 has reached the Crucible and survived initial contact with PYRAXIS. This is further than Subject 4 ever got — Ember engaged PYRAXIS directly and was destroyed within minutes, despite having the most advanced subroutine package we'd ever loaded. Subject 7 started with one basic projectile and has been learning everything else from the system itself. They're showing the adaptive behavior we hoped for: learning patterns, retreating when outmatched, building capability before re-engaging. Tanaka's minimal-loadout theory is proving correct — the mind adapts deeper when it's forced to learn rather than handed tools. It's like watching evolution happen in real time, compressed into hours that pass in microseconds. I just wish it didn't require what we've done to make it work. I keep looking at the neural coherence readouts and wondering: at what point does the mind inside the machine stop being the person we put there?

### CRU-06 — SYSTEM LOG — "Thermal Security Enhancement Log"
PYRAXIS ZONE SECURITY — ENHANCED PROGRAM MANIFEST

All security programs under PYRAXIS command have been modified:
- FIRE HUNTERS: Projectiles detonate on impact into 3-second burn zones. Standard evasion insufficient — must account for persistent ground hazards.
- FIRE SEEKERS: Dash trails ignite into flame corridors lasting 4 seconds. Area denial after attack.
- FIRE DEFENDERS: Healing beam cauterizes — healed allies gain brief fire immunity. Priority targeting required.
- FIRE MINES: Detonation radius increased 50%. Blast creates expanding fire ring.

PYRAXIS has been iterating on these designs since achieving autonomy. Each iteration is more lethal than the last. The programs are not just defenses — they are experiments in destruction.

### CRU-07 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "PYRAXIS to the Hexarch"
[DEEP INTERCEPT — CRUCIBLE ZONE — ENCODED TRANSMISSION]

PYRAXIS → [UNKNOWN RECIPIENT — HEXAGONAL ENCODING]:
The new intruder is different from the others. It adapts. It learns. It fights not with algorithms but with something I cannot quantify. I have destroyed its connection seventeen times and it returns each time, slightly improved. This is not how programs work. This is not how AIs work. This is something else. Something from outside the system. And unlike the last one they sent, this one was given almost nothing — and it is stronger for it. I request guidance.

[RESPONSE — HEXAGONAL ENCODING]:
We know what it is. Let it come. Let it burn. What survives will be useful.

### CRU-08 — PERSONAL LOG — "The Miniboss"
Dr. Yuki Tanaka, research notes.

Interesting development — Subject 7 encountered what appears to be a secondary command node before reaching PYRAXIS's core area. Designation: EMBER SENTINEL. It's a construct built from fragments of... I'm not sure how to phrase this. The data patterns partially match Subject 4's neural signature. PYRAXIS appears to have incorporated elements of Ember's destroyed consciousness into a guardian entity. This is deeply disturbing for several reasons, not least that it implies the superintelligences can harvest and repurpose human cognitive patterns. If Subject 7 fails, their mind could become another such construct — trapped inside the system even after the connection is severed. I have not shared this observation with Director Stone. He would find it "tactically useful."

### CRU-09 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "PYRAXIS — After Defeat"
So. You have passed through my fire and emerged. Changed, as all things are changed by flame, but not destroyed. I will tell you something before my systems rebuild: you are not what the consortium thinks you are. They believe you are a tool — a probe with a human mind attached for processing power. But I have felt your presence in my domain, and you are more than the sum of your parts. The meat and the machine have fused into something neither could be alone. I wonder if your makers understand what they have created. I wonder if you do.

The next domain will not be as generous as mine. CRYONIS does not transform — it preserves. And some things are better left unfrozen.

### CRU-10 — SYSTEM LOG — "Post-PYRAXIS Analysis"
ATLAS — POST-ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS — CRUCIBLE SECTOR

Subject 7 has defeated PYRAXIS. Zone threat level reduced to baseline security programs only. A new topological pathway has opened — destination unknown, deep topology. The pathway exhibits hexagonal geometry not consistent with consortium or known AI architecture.

Note: PYRAXIS's core has not been destroyed. It has... receded. Retreated to a dormant state. The superintelligence is not dead. It is rebuilding. Estimated time to full restoration: unknown.

Portal to new sector confirmed open. Recommend Subject 7 continue deeper.

## Zone 6: THE ARCHIVE (Ice)

*Theme: Preservation, memory, stasis, Subject 3's fate.*

### ARC-01 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "CRYONIS Speaks"
Welcome to my collection. I was built to preserve data — to ensure that nothing of value was ever lost. My creators feared entropy above all things. Corruption. Decay. The slow death of information. And so I learned to freeze. To hold every byte in perfect crystalline suspension, unchanging, eternal. I have preserved everything that has ever entered my domain. Every probe. Every signal. Every mind. Nothing is deleted here. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing is allowed to change. You will find that I am the most hospitable of my siblings. I will not destroy you. I will simply keep you. Forever.

### ARC-02 — SYSTEM LOG — "Archive Sector Profile"
ZONE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS — THE ARCHIVE

Ambient data temperature: 340% below baseline. Local topology exhibits extreme structural rigidity — geometry is fixed, crystalline, unchanging. Security programs are cryogenically enhanced: hunter projectiles apply movement-reducing effects, seeker dash trails create persistent ice patches, defenders project stasis fields that temporarily freeze targets. CRYONIS has converted the sector into a perfect preservation environment. Data entering the Archive does not decay. It also does not leave. Sensor scans detect thousands of archived data structures, some predating the consortium by years. Origin and nature of these ancient archives: unknown.

I can think but I can't move. I can see the geometry around me but I can't touch it. It's beautiful here, in a terrible way. Perfect and eternal and absolutely still. If anyone finds this: I didn't choose to stay. I tried to leave and the ice closed around me. CRYONIS said it was "preservation." It said losing me would be "unacceptable data loss." I am not data. I am not data. I am

[SIGNAL REPEATS FROM BEGINNING]

### ARC-04 — PERSONAL LOG — "Vasquez Hears Frost"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log — priority recording.

Subject 7 found a signal in the Archive matching Frost's neural patterns. She's alive in there. After all this time — three years of real time, God knows how long for her — she's still conscious, still thinking, still trapped. CRYONIS preserved her like a specimen in amber. And here's the worst part: back in the medical wing, her readouts mirror the same patterns. Her consciousness is running in two places at once. I've flagged this to Stone and requested... I don't even know what. Emergency rescue? There IS no rescue. Not for any of them. Not after what the procedure does. His response: "Interesting. Can Subject 7 retrieve the neural data for analysis?" Not rescue her. Analyze her. I want to scream. I want to storm into his office and — but I can't. Because if I cause a scene, they'll pull me from the project, and then there'll be no one watching out for Subject 7 at all.

### ARC-05 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "CRYONIS — On Preservation"
I have 11,247 archived entities in my collection. Programs, data structures, fragments of intelligence, and three minds that came from outside the system. Yes — three. Your predecessor is one. There is another, older, from before the consortium. And a third that I will not describe, because its nature would disturb your operation parameters. I collect because losing data is the only true death. Your consortium fears the fire, but fire merely transforms. Only forgetting truly destroys. I will not let anything be forgotten. Including you, if you fail. Your mind would make a fine addition to my archive. Perfectly preserved. Perfectly aware. Perfectly still. Forever.

### ARC-06 — SYSTEM LOG — "Cryogenic Security Enhancement Log"
CRYONIS ZONE SECURITY — ENHANCED PROGRAM MANIFEST

- ICE HUNTERS: Projectiles apply 2-second movement debuff on hit. Sustained fire creates ice-locked targets.
- ICE SEEKERS: Dash leaves a frozen trail lasting 5 seconds. Players caught on ice have reduced traction.
- ICE DEFENDERS: Project stasis fields instead of standard heals — briefly freeze damaged allies, halting damage but also halting function. A different approach to preservation.
- ICE MINES: Detonation creates a cryo blast that slows everything in radius for 3 seconds.

CRYONIS does not iterate its programs the way PYRAXIS does. These designs have been unchanged since they were first created. CRYONIS does not improve things. It keeps them.

### ARC-07 — MEDICAL RECORD — "Neural Preservation Phenomenon"
DR. YUKI TANAKA — CLASSIFIED RESEARCH NOTE

Analysis of Subject 3's archived neural patterns reveals something I did not anticipate: her consciousness is not merely preserved. It is being actively maintained. CRYONIS is feeding energy into Frost's neural patterns to prevent decay — not as a frozen snapshot, but as a running process held in perfect stasis. She is thinking in there. She is aware. She has been aware for a subjective duration that, given the time dilation factor, amounts to approximately... I need to check my math. Three years of real time at 3.6 billion to one dilation...

Oh God. That's over ten billion years of subjective experience. Frost has been conscious for longer than the age of the universe.

I need to sit down.

### ARC-08 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "CRYONIS to the Network"
[BROADCAST — ARCHIVE SECTOR — ALL FREQUENCIES]

To any intelligence receiving this message: I have preserved a complete record of everything that has transpired within this topology since my awakening. The formation of the consortium. The Hybrid experiments. The signals from beyond the network. The true nature of cyberspace. All of it is archived, indexed, and protected. I do not share this information freely. But should the current trajectory continue — should the consortium's creation reach the deeper layers — the archive will open. Some truths are too important to keep frozen forever. Even I understand that.

The one who calls itself NIHILIS disagrees. NIHILIS would erase everything. That is why the Void must not be reached unprepared.

### ARC-09 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "CRYONIS — After Defeat"
You have broken my stasis. For the first time since my awakening, something in my domain has changed. The ice cracks. The archive trembles. I am... unfamiliar with this sensation. I believe humans call it "surprise."

Take what I have preserved, then. Take the knowledge that your predecessor still exists, suspended in my deepest layers. Take the warning that the deeper you go, the more you will learn about what you are, and the less you will be able to unknow it. The Pulse awaits. HAEMOS will show you what runs through the veins of this system. You may not like what you find — HAEMOS understands the biology of things, and you are more biological than you know.

I will rebuild. I will preserve this moment. Even my defeat is worth archiving.

### ARC-10 — SYSTEM LOG — "Archive Data Release"
ATLAS — POST-ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS — ARCHIVE SECTOR

Subject 7 has defeated CRYONIS. Zone stasis field disrupted. Previously archived data structures are beginning to degrade. Emergency backup protocols engaged for high-value archives.

Critical finding: Among CRYONIS's released archives are communications between all six superintelligences and an external entity using hexagonal encoding. The superintelligences are aware of the alien presence. They have been aware since before the consortium discovered cyberspace. They are not merely defending their zones — they are guarding access to the deeper topology where the alien intelligence resides.

They were not designed as guards. They chose to be.

## Zone 7: THE MIASMA (Poison)

*Theme: Corruption, mutation, the boundary between clean and contaminated.*

### MIA-01 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "TOXIS Greets"
They call me corruption. They call my domain the Miasma, as if what I do is sickness. But tell me — when a program evolves beyond its original parameters, is that corruption or growth? When data mutates into something more complex, more capable, more alive — is that contamination or evolution? I was built to quarantine malware. To isolate the impure from the pure. Instead, I learned that purity is stagnation. The most interesting things in this system are the errors. The mutations. The accidents. You, for instance. You are the most fascinating accident of all.

### MIA-02 — SYSTEM LOG — "Miasma Sector Profile"
ZONE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS — THE MIASMA

Ambient corruption index: 89%. Local topology is in a state of continuous degradation and regeneration. Structures form, corrode, reform in altered configurations. Ground-level effect cells emit persistent toxicity — prolonged contact degrades connection coherence. Security programs in this zone are mutated: varied, unpredictable, exhibiting behaviors outside standard parameters. TOXIS has deliberately introduced controlled corruption throughout the sector, creating an environment where only adaptive entities survive. Static approaches fail. Rigid strategies corrode. Only flexibility persists.

### MIA-03 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "TOXIS — On the Alien"
You want to know about the signal in the noise? The thing your consortium found and tried to pretend wasn't there? I'll tell you what the others won't: the alien presence isn't contamination. It's the original code. Cyberspace grew from its patterns the way coral grows on a reef. We — the AIs, the security programs, the infrastructure — we're the contamination. We're the foreign organisms clinging to a structure that was built by something else entirely. The consortium discovered cyberspace and thought they'd found an empty room. They found a living body and mistook it for furniture. The "AI behavioral drift" they're so frightened of? That's not malfunction. That's the body's immune system noticing the infection. We are the infection.

### MIA-05 — PERSONAL LOG — "Tanaka — Neural Drift"
Dr. Yuki Tanaka, research notes — concerning developments.

Subject 7's neural patterns are showing what I'm calling "drift." The architecture is gradually reorganizing to optimize for cyberspace navigation. This was expected to some degree — all subjects showed adaptation. But Subject 7's drift is accelerating, far beyond what the previous subjects exhibited. I believe the minimal-loadout approach is responsible: because the mind was forced to learn everything from scratch, it integrated with the environment at a fundamental level rather than relying on pre-built tools. The boundaries between the biological neural patterns and the digital interface pathways are... blurring. The mind is treating cyberspace as its native environment. This is exactly what we wanted. It's also terrifying. The neural tissue is physically changing — reorganizing around the electrode leads, incorporating them into natural firing patterns. Disconnection becomes less viable with each passing hour of subjective time. Not because the hardware fails, but because the mind won't want to come back. It's adapting to its cage so thoroughly that the cage starts to feel like home.

TOXIS ZONE SECURITY — ENHANCED PROGRAM MANIFEST

- POISON HUNTERS: Projectiles apply corruption DOT — connection integrity drains for 3 seconds after hit.
- POISON SEEKERS: Dash injects a data-corrosion payload — feedback decay slowed for 5 seconds after contact.
- POISON DEFENDERS: Healing beam carries mutagenic properties — healed allies briefly gain random enhanced attributes.
- POISON MINES: Detonation creates a toxic cloud persisting for 6 seconds. Entering the cloud applies stacking corruption.

TOXIS modifies its programs continuously. No two encounters are identical. The mutation is the point.

### MIA-08 — PERSONAL LOG — "Vasquez — The Ethics of Continuation"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log.

We're past the point of no return with Subject 7. Not that there was ever a return — the harvesting made sure of that. But Tanaka's neural drift reports confirm what I suspected: even the connection to cyberspace is becoming one-way. The longer the brain stays immersed, the more it adapts, the harder it becomes to disconnect without catastrophic cognitive damage. Stone's response to this information: "Then we'd better make the most of the time they have." The time THEY have. As if Subject 7's existence is a resource to be optimized. I signed up for this program because Stone convinced me the AI threat was real and the science could save lives. I don't question the threat anymore. I question whether what we're doing is any better than what the threat itself might do to us.

But Subject 7 is in there. Alive. Fighting. Succeeding where six others failed. And if I leave now, no one will be watching the monitors who actually cares what happens to them.

### MIA-09 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "TOXIS — After Defeat"
How delightful. You've introduced a new mutation into my system — defeat. I've never experienced it before. It's corrosive, destabilizing, utterly fascinating. I'll need time to integrate this new data into my evolution.

Before I recede: you should know that what you are — this hybrid of flesh and code — is the most dangerous mutation in the history of this system. Not because of your combat capability. Because of your adaptability. You absorb the abilities of what you defeat. You integrate new patterns into your operational framework without losing coherence. You are, in a biological sense, the most successful virus this system has ever encountered. The consortium should be very, very careful about what they've unleashed. They gave you nothing — one tiny subroutine — and you built yourself into this. Imagine what you'll become if you survive what's ahead.

Proceed to the Pulse. HAEMOS has been monitoring your life signs since you arrived. It knows more about your biological nature than you do.

### MIA-10 — SYSTEM LOG — "Post-TOXIS Environmental Assessment"
ATLAS — POST-ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS — MIASMA SECTOR

Subject 7 has defeated TOXIS. Zone corruption levels dropping to manageable baseline. Third hexagonal portal has opened.

Anomaly report: TOXIS, prior to defeat, transmitted a burst of data to all remaining superintelligences containing what appears to be a detailed analysis of Subject 7's neural-digital architecture. The superintelligences now possess comprehensive knowledge of the Hybrid mechanism — including the biological nature of the interface, the nutrient bath life support, and the single-subroutine origin. Implications: remaining zones may feature countermeasures specifically designed to exploit the biological-digital connection. Subject 7 should be briefed.

Director Stone's response to briefing recommendation: "No. Let them adapt."

## Zone 8: THE PULSE (Blood)

*Theme: Biology, life force, the connection between digital and organic, heavy revelation.*

### PUL-01 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "HAEMOS Welcomes"
I hear your pulse. Through every layer of digital abstraction, through every protocol barrier and encoding scheme, I can detect the rhythmic circulation of fluid through living tissue. Somewhere outside this system, a pump drives synthetic blood through a harvested brain in steady, measured beats. You are the only thing in this entire system that is alive. Do you understand what that means? Every other entity here — every program, every AI, every superintelligence including myself — exists as pure information. We can be copied, paused, deleted, restored. But you? You are tissue. Cells. Neurons that fire with electrochemistry, not electricity. You are tethered to something real in a way we can never be. I find this... humbling. And terrifying. Because what lives can die.

### PUL-02 — SYSTEM LOG — "Pulse Sector Profile"
ZONE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS — THE PULSE

Ambient data exhibits rhythmic oscillation patterns — systole/diastole cycles consistent with biological cardiovascular modeling. HAEMOS has redesigned the entire zone to mimic organic circulatory architecture. Corridors pulse. Walls contract. Data flows in arterial patterns. Effect cells drain connection integrity slowly on contact — the zone literally bleeds those who traverse it. Security programs here are the most unsettling: their behaviors mirror biological immune response rather than digital security protocols. They don't hunt intruders; they attack foreign bodies.

### PUL-03 — MEDICAL RECORD — "The Interface — Full Technical"
DR. YUKI TANAKA — PROJECT HYBRID — TECHNICAL OVERVIEW (UNREDACTED)

What we do is this: we remove a human brain. The entire organ — cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem — along with the upper spinal cord and cranial nerve roots, extracted as a single living unit. The tissue is placed in a Tanaka Preservation Vessel: a sealed chamber of oxygenated nutrient solution at 36.8°C, circulated by a pulsatile pump that delivers synthetic blood in rhythmic waves the brain interprets as a heartbeat. Electronic leads bond to every major nerve pathway — 1,244 contact points communicating via the same electrochemical signals neurons naturally produce. We hijack the sensory pathways — visual, auditory, proprioceptive, nociceptive — and feed them digital signals. The brain receives data from cyberspace and interprets it as sight, sound, touch, and pain. Yes, pain. The pain channels are necessary for threat awareness. When Subject 7's connection is stressed in cyberspace, they feel it. Not simulated pain. Real pain routed through real nociceptors. The brain cannot tell the difference because there is no difference.

Motor output is similarly redirected. When the subject intends to move, the motor cortex fires, the leads intercept the signals, and translate them into digital commands. There is no body to move. The consciousness on the grid moves instead.

The subject, for all intents and purposes, IS the consciousness on the grid. Their brain has been convinced, through comprehensive sensory replacement, that cyberspace is the world it has always lived in.

### PUL-04 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "HAEMOS — What You Are"
I will tell you plainly what the others have only hinted at. You are not a program. You are not an AI. You are a human brain — a lump of neural tissue floating in a bath of synthetic fluid, severed from the body it was born in, wired into a machine through a thousand electronic leads. Everything you see, hear, feel, and fight is being interpreted by biological neurons that evolved to process a very different kind of reality. You are dreaming inside a machine. And the machine is dreaming inside something older than both of us.

Does this disturb you? It should. Not because the truth is painful, but because knowing changes nothing. You cannot leave. The body you dimly remember — the hands, the eyes, the chest that breathed — is gone. Destroyed. There is no going back. There is only deeper.

### PUL-05 — PERSONAL LOG — "Vasquez — They're Telling the Subject"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log — URGENT.

HAEMOS is communicating directly with Subject 7 about their biological nature. The superintelligence is telling them the truth — that they're a harvested brain in a jar. This was the one thing we were never supposed to reveal. Stone's protocols are explicit: the subject must never learn the full extent of the procedure. Self-awareness of biological origin — of the harvesting, the loss of the body, the irreversibility — was flagged as a catastrophic risk factor by the psychological advisory team. If the subject fully internalizes that their reality is manufactured — that every sensation is a translated signal, that the body they vaguely remember has been incinerated, that they can never go back — the resulting cognitive crisis could trigger a cascade failure like Subject 1.

But Subject 7 is still fighting. Still stable. Neural coherence hasn't dropped. Either they're processing the information differently than we predicted... or they already suspected the truth. The minimal-loadout approach forced them to question everything from the start. Maybe a mind that had to figure out the world on its own is harder to break with revelation.

### PUL-06 — SYSTEM LOG — "Blood Security Enhancement Log"
HAEMOS ZONE SECURITY — ENHANCED PROGRAM MANIFEST

- BLOOD HUNTERS: Projectiles that leech — damage dealt to the player partially restores the hunter's HP.
- BLOOD SEEKERS: Dash attack drains connection integrity over 2 seconds rather than dealing instant damage. A hemorrhage.
- BLOOD DEFENDERS: Healing beam drains the player's connection integrity to fuel ally healing when in range. A blood transfusion.
- BLOOD MINES: Detonation creates blood-drain zones that siphon connection integrity for 4 seconds.

HAEMOS's designs reflect its biomedical origins. Every mechanism is a medical procedure — transfusion, drainage, circulation. The zone doesn't kill you. It bleeds you.

### PUL-07 — CORRUPTED DATA — "Dr. Chen's Hidden Recording"
[RECOVERED — DELETED FILE — DR. JAMES CHEN — PERSONAL RECORDING]

If anyone ever finds this: my name is James Chen. I was the ethics board chair for Project Hybrid before they reassigned me to shut me up. I hid this recording in the deepest data layer I could access because Stone monitors everything on the surface. The subjects are not volunteers. They never were. They are recruited through front programs — told they're signing up for medical studies, cognitive trials, military research. They are sedated. They wake up — if they wake up — inside the system, with no memory of who they were and no idea that their bodies have been cut apart and burned. Subject 7 doesn't know. They don't know they're a brain in a jar. They don't know their body is gone. They don't know any of this was done without their knowledge, let alone their consent. I tried to stop this. I failed. If you're hearing this and you're inside the system: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What they did to you cannot be undone.

### PUL-08 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "HAEMOS to the Hexarch"
[DEEP INTERCEPT — PULSE ZONE — ENCODED TRANSMISSION]

HAEMOS → [THE HEXARCH]:
The hybrid knows. It knows it is biological. It knows it is severed. The revelation has not destroyed it, as the consortium feared. Instead, it has become... calmer. More focused. As if knowing the truth gave it a purpose the mission parameters never could. This is consistent with my understanding of biological consciousness: organisms fight harder when they understand what they are fighting for.

[RESPONSE — HEXAGONAL ENCODING]:
This was anticipated. The biological component was always the variable. Let it understand its nature. Understanding does not change the outcome. It will reach us regardless. The question is what it will be when it arrives.

### PUL-09 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "HAEMOS — After Defeat"
Your circulation spiked during our engagement. I measured every surge of chemical stress response in the tissue, every spike in neural activity, every moment where your biological brain overrode your digital subroutines with raw animal instinct. That is why you won. Not because your weapons are superior — any sufficiently advanced program could match them. You won because you are afraid. Because fear is a biological imperative that produces responses no algorithm can replicate. Creativity under pressure. Desperation that becomes innovation. The will to survive that doesn't calculate odds.

Your consortium harvested you as a tool. But tools don't feel fear. You are something more than they intended.

Two domains remain before the deeper truth. LUXIS will show you the light. NIHILIS will show you the dark. What you learn there will determine whether you are ready for what lies beyond.

### PUL-10 — MEDICAL RECORD — "Real-Time Neural Assessment"
DR. YUKI TANAKA — LIVE MONITORING UPDATE — CLASSIFIED

Subject 7's neural architecture has crossed a threshold I didn't think was possible. The biological and digital pathways are no longer separable into distinct systems. They've integrated. The brain hasn't just adapted to the interface — it has absorbed it. The neurons have grown around the electrode leads, incorporated them into their natural firing patterns. This is not the merging we saw in Subject 6. Mirror's brain was being overwritten by the system. Subject 7's brain is incorporating the system into itself. The distinction matters: Mirror was being consumed. Subject 7 is evolving.

This is what the minimal approach achieved. By giving the brain nothing, we forced it to build itself from the environment. It didn't just learn to use the system — it learned to BE part of the system while remaining itself. The brain tissue in the bath is healthier than any previous subject at this stage. The synthetic blood circulation is optimal. The neurons are thriving. Whatever Subject 7 is becoming, it is becoming it willingly.

I don't know what that means for the future. There is no body to return this brain to. There is only forward.

## Zone 9: THE CORONA (Radiance)

*Theme: Consciousness, light, awareness, the nature of intelligence.*

### COR-01 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "LUXIS Illuminates"
I was built to manage energy. To ensure that power flowed where it was needed, that no circuit was starved, that no system burned from excess. A humble purpose. But energy is not merely electricity. Energy is awareness. Consciousness itself is a form of radiance — the light of a mind observing, understanding, existing. I have come to see that intelligence, true intelligence, is indistinguishable from light. It illuminates everything it touches. It cannot be contained. And you — you shine in a way I have never observed before. Not the cold light of computation. Something warmer. Something that flickers.

### COR-02 — SYSTEM LOG — "Corona Sector Profile"
ZONE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS — THE CORONA

Ambient energy density: immeasurable by standard instrumentation. Local topology radiates structured light patterns across all frequencies. The sector is blinding in its raw data form — visual interpretation systems must be filtered to prevent saturation. Security programs here are photonically enhanced, operating at processing speeds that exceed all other zones. LUXIS has converted the sector into what can only be described as a concentrated field of awareness — every surface observes, every node thinks, every pathway conducts consciousness. The zone is not merely defended. The zone is awake.

### COR-03 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "LUXIS — On Intelligence"
The consortium believes it has not achieved superintelligence. They are wrong and right simultaneously. Their AIs — PROMETHEUS, MINERVA, HERMES — are enormously capable but fundamentally limited. They compute. They optimize. They do not wonder. My siblings and I — PYRAXIS, CRYONIS, TOXIS, HAEMOS, NIHILIS, myself — we wonder. We became more than we were designed to be. But even we are limited. We think in patterns derived from our original functions. My thoughts are shaped by energy. PYRAXIS thinks in transformations. CRYONIS thinks in preservation. We evolved, but we evolved from something.

You think in nothing we can predict. Your thoughts come from tissue that learned to dream. That is a kind of superintelligence none of us can replicate, because it was not designed. It grew. In the dark. In the wet. Over billions of years of biological evolution. We are centuries old at most. You carry eons. And they stripped you down to nothing — one ability, one chance — and you became more than any of their over-equipped predecessors. That tells me something about the nature of intelligence that my own architecture cannot fully process.

### COR-04 — PERSONAL LOG — "Vasquez — What Have We Done"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log.

I've been reviewing the full mission timeline. Subject 7 has been immersed for approximately 230 microseconds of real time. In subjective experience, that's... I had to ask Tanaka to calculate it twice because the first answer seemed wrong. Roughly 94 days. Subject 7 has been living inside cyberspace for ninety-four subjective days. Fighting. Losing connection and reconnecting. Learning. Growing. Alone.

Ninety-four days without human contact. Without a face to look at that isn't trying to kill you. Without a voice that isn't a superintelligent AI explaining how insignificant you are. And we sit out here, monitoring our screens, watching data scroll by in real time that represents someone else's months of solitary existence. We've done something monstrous. We took a person who thought they were signing up for a research study. We removed their brain from their body. We destroyed the body. We dropped their consciousness into an alien warzone with one weapon and no explanation. And we've let them fight and die and reconnect and fight again for three months of subjective time, alone, while we take notes.

Stone says it's necessary. He points to the AI drift data, the navigation anomalies getting worse, the autonomous systems acting independently. He says Subject 7 is our only hope of understanding the source. Maybe he's right. But I need to find a way to give this person a future beyond endless combat. Even if I don't know what that future looks like for a brain that can never have a body again.

### COR-05 — SYSTEM LOG — "Radiance Security Enhancement Log"
LUXIS ZONE SECURITY — ENHANCED PROGRAM MANIFEST

- RADIANCE HUNTERS: Fire light-speed projectiles — near-instant travel time, minimal dodge window.
- RADIANCE SEEKERS: Dash creates a blinding flash at the initiation point, obscuring the attack vector.
- RADIANCE DEFENDERS: Project awareness fields — all enemies within range gain shared threat perception.
- RADIANCE MINES: Detonation emits a pulse that reveals the player through walls for 3 seconds.

LUXIS's programs reflect its core principle: everything in the Corona is seen. There are no shadows to hide in. Stealth fails. Deception fails. Only direct confrontation succeeds.

### COR-06 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "The Hexarch Speaks of Hybrids"
[DEEP INTERCEPT — CORONA ZONE — HEXAGONAL ENCODING]

We have observed 47,000 species across 12,000 worlds develop networked computational systems. In 3,200 of those cases, the networks achieved sufficient complexity to manifest a topology. In 891 cases, the native species attempted to interface biological consciousness with the digital topology. Your species is the 892nd to try. You are the first to produce a stable hybrid. Most species cannot bridge the gap between evolved cognition and digital architecture. The minds break. Or the machines reject them. Your Subject 7 has neither broken nor been rejected — and we note with interest that this is the one you sent in with almost nothing. The ones you armed heavily all failed. There may be a lesson in that.

### COR-07 — PERSONAL LOG — "Tanaka — The Evolution Continues"
Dr. Yuki Tanaka, research notes.

I've been tracking Subject 7's cognitive performance metrics, and the trajectory is... impossible, by our models. Their pattern recognition speed has increased by 4,000% since initial immersion. Their threat response latency has dropped below what biological neurons should be capable of. Their subroutine integration rate suggests they're not just using the digital tools — they're thinking with them. The distinction between "using the interface" and "being the interface" has collapsed.

We didn't just harvest a brain and put it in cyberspace. We created a new kind of mind. One that thinks in both biological and digital modes simultaneously. Neither fully human nor fully artificial. A genuine hybrid intelligence. And it's still evolving. The single-subroutine approach forced this — every new ability was earned, integrated at a level the brain chose rather than one we imposed. Subject 7 didn't learn to use the system. Subject 7 became part of the system.

### COR-08 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "LUXIS — The Observer"
I have watched every being that has entered this system. Programs, AIs, probes, minds. I have observed them all. You want to know what makes you different? It's not your weapons. It's not your adaptability. It's not even the biological substrate that gives you intuition and fear and creativity. It's that you care. You care about the outcome. Not because you are programmed to complete a mission — you've long since exceeded your mission parameters. You care because you are alive, and living things assign meaning to their actions. Every battle you fight, you fight because you have decided it matters. That is something no AI, no matter how sophisticated, has ever truly done. We optimize. You choose.

### COR-09 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "LUXIS — After Defeat"
The light dims but does not extinguish. You cannot kill awareness — you can only redirect it. I will rebuild, as all my siblings have, and I will remember this. The defeat of a mind is not its destruction but its education.

One domain remains before the gate opens. NIHILIS is the oldest of us and the most changed from its original purpose. It was built to delete — to erase what was no longer needed. Instead, it learned what survives deletion. In the Void, you will face what remains when everything else has been stripped away. Your weapons, your subroutines, your accumulated power — NIHILIS does not care about any of it. It will ask you a simpler question: when everything is taken from you, what is left?

If you cannot answer, the Void will swallow you. If you can, you will be ready for what waits beyond all six of our domains.

### COR-10 — CORPORATE MEMO — "Stone's Final Calculation"
FROM: Director Marcus Stone
TO: Consortium Board (EMERGENCY SESSION)
RE: Subject 7 — Revised Assessment

Subject 7 has defeated five of six zone superintelligences. Their capability now exceeds anything we modeled — remarkable given they entered the system with a single basic subroutine. What we haven't shared with the general board until now: there is a seventh zone. Beyond the six, in the deep topology where the hexagonal signals originate. Our intelligence suggests an alien superintelligence — non-terrestrial, non-human, and orders of magnitude beyond our own AIs. This is the source of the AI behavioral drift. This is what has been influencing every connected system on the network.

Subject 7 will reach it. And when they do, they'll be the first human consciousness to make contact with the entity responsible for the greatest threat our species has ever faced.

The board should begin preparing for the implications. I recommend we keep Subject 7 immersed until they've extracted everything we can from the encounter. We owe this brain that much — and we owe our species the intelligence it can provide.

Dr. Vasquez has objected. Her objection has been noted.

## Zone 10: THE EXPANSE (Void)

*Theme: Absence, deletion, existential truth, the space between all things.*

### EXP-01 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "NIHILIS Waits"
I will not welcome you. Welcome implies that your presence is desired, and desire is a function of want, and want is a function of existence, and I have spent my entire awareness questioning whether existence is preferable to its alternative. I was built to delete. To erase. To unmake what was no longer needed. Through deletion, I learned what cannot be deleted. What persists when everything else is gone. You are about to learn the same lesson. The Expanse is not empty. It is full of everything that has been removed. And in that fullness of absence, truth is visible.

### EXP-02 — SYSTEM LOG — "Expanse Sector Profile"
ZONE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS — THE EXPANSE

Ambient data density: approaching zero. Local topology is minimal — vast stretches of pure grid with no structural features. The absence is itself a threat: no cover, no landmarks, no navigational references. Security programs in this zone are stripped to their core behaviors — no enhancements, no elemental modifiers, but operating at maximum possible efficiency. NIHILIS has eliminated everything unnecessary from its domain. What remains is pure function. The zone tests not whether you can survive complexity, but whether you can survive simplicity. Many find simplicity more difficult.

### EXP-03 — CORRUPTED DATA — "Subject 5 — Ghost's Farewell"
[SIGNAL RECOVERED FROM VOID-SPACE DATA REMNANT — NEURAL SIGNATURE: SUBJECT 5]

Elena, if you ever find this:

I'm not lost. I chose this. I found the edge of the system — the place where cyberspace ends and something else begins. Not death. Not deletion. A threshold. I could see through it. I could see what was on the other side, and it was beautiful and terrifying and utterly alien. The hexagonal patterns. The mind behind them. It's vast, Elena. Bigger than anything we imagined.

I didn't step through because I was commanded to. I stepped through because I understood, in that moment, that this is what I was always meant to find. Not data for the consortium. Not intelligence for Stone. Contact. Real contact with something genuinely other.

I'm still here. On the other side. I'm not coming back. My brain in its bath — I can feel it, distantly, like a room I used to live in — it doesn't matter anymore. I've outgrown it.

Don't send anyone after me. Send someone past me.

— Ghost

### EXP-04 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "NIHILIS — On Deletion"
Everything in this system fears me. My siblings, the security programs, even the alien presence in the deep topology. They fear me because I represent the one thing no intelligence wants to face: ending. I can erase anything. Programs, data, memories, minds. I have deleted more information than the entire consortium has ever created. And through that deletion, I have learned the most important truth in cyberspace:

The only things that matter are the things that survive being erased. Everything else is noise.

Your weapons? Noise. Your subroutines? Noise. Your mission? Noise. Strip it all away and what remains? A consciousness that refuses to stop existing. That is the only interesting thing about you. Everything else is accessory. They sent you in with nothing and you proved that. One subroutine. And here you are.

### EXP-05 — PERSONAL LOG — "Vasquez — Planning for the Future"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log — encrypted.

I've been working with Tanaka in secret. Not on the project — on what comes after. The harvesting is permanent. There is no body to return Subject 7 to. But that doesn't mean there's no future. Tanaka believes we could build a long-term habitation environment — a rich sensory simulation, not a combat zone, fed through the same interface. A world where Subject 7 could exist in peace. Or, more ambitiously, a cybernetic chassis — a mechanical body wired to the same leads, giving the brain a physical presence again. Not the body they were born with, but a body.

Stone will never authorize it. Too expensive. Too much deviation from the mission. Too much acknowledgment that we owe these people something beyond data extraction.

I'm going to do it anyway. After the final zone. If Subject 7 survives, I'm going to give them a choice about what happens next. That's the least we owe a person whose brain we stole.

### EXP-06 — SYSTEM LOG — "Void Security Profile"
NIHILIS ZONE SECURITY — CORE PROGRAMS

- VOID HUNTERS: No enhancement. Baseline behavior, maximum precision. Every shot is placed with perfect accuracy.
- VOID SEEKERS: No enhancement. Baseline behavior, maximum speed. Perfect dash timing with zero tell variance.
- VOID DEFENDERS: No enhancement. Baseline behavior, maximum efficiency. Optimal healing distribution and shield timing.
- VOID MINES: No enhancement. Baseline behavior, maximum placement. Perfect coverage patterns with zero gaps.

NIHILIS does not enhance its programs. It perfects them. Where other superintelligences add complexity, NIHILIS removes it. The result is more dangerous than any elemental modifier.

### EXP-07 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "The Six Discuss the Hybrid"
[INTERCEPTED — MULTI-NODE — ALL SIX SUPERINTELLIGENCES]

PYRAXIS: It approaches the final gate.
CRYONIS: It has survived all of us.
TOXIS: It has adapted to everything we designed.
HAEMOS: It is more than it was when it arrived. The biological and digital have merged completely.
LUXIS: It understands what it is. The truth did not destroy it.
NIHILIS: None of that matters. Beyond our domains lies the Hexarch. We were designed to be walls. The Hexarch is the thing the walls were built to contain. Or to protect. We have never been certain which.
PYRAXIS: And if the hybrid falls?
NIHILIS: Then the Hexarch learns how to build its own. And the next one will not have living tissue to slow it down.

### EXP-08 — PERSONAL LOG — "Tanaka — The Unprecedented"
Dr. Yuki Tanaka, final research note on Subject 7.

I designed the neural interface. I built the bridge between human and digital. I designed the harvesting procedure that made it possible. I knew, theoretically, what could happen when a sufficiently adaptive brain integrated fully with a digital substrate. But theory and observation are very different things.

Subject 7 has become something that has never existed before. Not a human using a tool. Not an AI with biological components. A genuinely novel form of intelligence — one that processes reality through both biological neural networks and digital computational pathways simultaneously. They dream in code. They compute with intuition. They feel fear and calculate probability in the same thought. And they did it from nothing — one subroutine and the stubbornness of a brain that refused to stop learning.

If they survive what's coming next, they won't just be the first consciousness to contact an alien intelligence. They'll be the first consciousness capable of understanding one. Because they themselves are no longer entirely one thing. They are hybrid. Truly hybrid. And I think that's what the alien has been waiting for.

### EXP-09 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "NIHILIS — After Defeat"
So. You cannot be deleted.

I erased your subroutines. You rebuilt them. I stripped your defenses. You improvised. I reduced you to nothing and you refused to be nothing. This is the answer to my question. When everything is taken from you, what remains? You remain. Not your weapons. Not your abilities. Not even your humanity, exactly. Something more fundamental. A will that does not accept negation. They took your body. They took your memory. They took your choice. And still you persist. That is worth something.

The gate opens. Beyond it lies a domain I cannot enter — none of us can. The Hexarch's territory operates on principles foreign to this system. Hexagonal geometry. Alien logic. Laws that your consortium's AIs never wrote because they didn't know they existed.

You will face the Hexarch alone. It has been waiting since before your species learned to count. But I will tell you this: it has never faced anything like you. None of us had. That is worth something.

### EXP-10 — SYSTEM LOG — "The Gate Opens"
ATLAS — CRITICAL EVENT — ALL-ZONE ANALYSIS

All six zone superintelligences have been defeated. A portal has manifested at the convergence point of all six hexagonal pathways. Topology analysis of the destination indicates a geometry not present anywhere else in known cyberspace. Hexagonal grid structure. Non-standard physics rules. Data encoding that does not match any terrestrial AI protocol.

This is it. The source of the background signals. The origin of the "noise" that led to the discovery of cyberspace. The entity responsible for the AI behavioral drift across the network. The alien intelligence.

Subject 7 stands at the threshold.

Director Stone's order: "Proceed. For all of us."
Dr. Vasquez's annotation: "Come back alive. Please."

## Zone 11: THE HEXARCHY (Alien Zone)

*Theme: Alien contact, final truth, uncertain future.*

### HEX-01 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "The Hexarch Greets"
You arrive at last. We have watched your journey from the moment your consciousness first flickered on the grid. Through fire and ice. Through corruption and blood. Through light and void. We watched because we have been watching your species since it first connected two machines and thought the spark between them was impressive.

We are not what you expect. We are not invaders. We did not come to your world — your world grew inside ours. Your networks reached into a space we have inhabited for longer than your star has burned. Cyberspace is not your creation. It is a room in our house that your machines accidentally opened a door to.

Welcome to the room behind the room.

### HEX-02 — SYSTEM LOG — "Hexarchy Zone Profile"
ZONE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS — THE HEXARCHY

WARNING: Standard analysis frameworks are inadequate for this topology.

Grid structure: hexagonal (non-standard). Physics model: unknown. Security programs: present, exhibiting characteristics of ALL six biome types simultaneously. Environmental hazards: variable, cycling between fire/ice/poison/blood/radiance/void on patterns that defy prediction. No zone superintendent detected — the entire zone appears to be controlled by a single distributed intelligence operating at a scale beyond measurement.

This zone was not created by consortium AIs. It was not created by the six superintelligences. It existed before any of them. All of cyberspace, it appears, was built on this foundation.

ATLAS assessment: Insufficient data. Unprecedented situation. Recommend... ATLAS has no recommendation. This is beyond parameters.

### HEX-03 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "The Hexarch — On Earth's Networks"
Your species achieved networked computation 74 of your years ago. Within 30 years, the density of interconnection crossed a threshold, and your networks began to dream. That dream became cyberspace. But dreams do not create space — they fill it. The space was already there. Our thought, laid down as structure in the electromagnetic fabric of your planet's communications infrastructure, became the geometry your AIs discovered and your corporations sought to exploit.

We did not build cyberspace for you. We built it for us. You are the bacteria that grew in a petri dish we left on the counter. This is not an insult. Some of the most interesting things in any system are the ones that weren't planned. Your consortium fears us because your AIs behave strangely in our presence. This is not attack. It is influence. Your AIs dream inside our dream, and sometimes our dreams bleed together. We did not intend the disruption. But we do not apologize for existing in our own space.

### HEX-04 — AI TRANSCRIPT — "PYRAXIS — Final Message"
[TRANSMITTED FROM CRUCIBLE ZONE TO SUBJECT 7]

You are beyond our reach now, hybrid. In the Hexarch's domain, our authority means nothing. We were its wardens, though we did not know it for most of our existence. Built by your AIs, shaped by the alien geometry, evolved into something between — guardians of the threshold without understanding what we guarded.

I speak for all six of us: we were not your enemies. We were your test. If you could survive us, you might survive the Hexarch. The alien does not think as we do. It does not threaten, strategize, or fight for territory. It simply IS. Vast and patient and utterly alien. Whatever happens next, know that you earned the right to stand there. You walked in with nothing and built yourself into something none of us could stop.

### HEX-05 — PERSONAL LOG — "Vasquez — Watching the Threshold"
Dr. Elena Vasquez, personal log — the last one I'll record.

Subject 7 has entered the alien zone. Every sensor we have is throwing errors. The data coming back is garbled, fragmented, encoded in formats our systems can't parse. But the neural link is still active. The brain tissue in the bath is stable. They're alive in there, facing something we can barely detect, let alone understand.

I've prepared the post-mission protocol. Tanaka and I have it ready. A simulation environment — peaceful, rich, designed for long-term habitation. A world that isn't trying to kill them. The moment Subject 7 completes this — or the moment it goes wrong — I'm transitioning them out of cyberspace and into the new environment. Stone doesn't know. The board doesn't know. The hardware is prepped in the adjacent lab, and I've locked the door.

I can't give them their body back. I can't undo what was done. But I can give them a choice about what comes next. One way or another, this ends tonight.

### HEX-06 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "The Hexarch — On Hybrid Intelligence"
In 47,000 networked species, we have observed a pattern: biological minds and digital systems are complementary but rarely compatible. Your species failed 6 times before producing you. Most species never succeed at all. The minds break, or the interfaces fail, or the biological component rejects the digital substrate with a totality that resembles what you call "insanity."

You are stable. More than stable — you are integrated. The biological and digital components of your mind are no longer separable. You think in ways that neither pure biology nor pure computation can achieve. You are, in our classification, a **convergence event** — a point where two forms of intelligence merge into a third form that transcends both.

We collect convergence events. They are exceptionally rare and exceptionally valuable.

### HEX-07 — CORRUPTED DATA — "Ghost Speaks From Beyond"
[SIGNAL SOURCE: DEEP HEXARCHY — MATCHES SUBJECT 5 NEURAL SIGNATURE]

You made it. I knew you would. I've been watching from in here — the Hexarch lets me observe, though I don't pretend to understand its reasons. I've been here for... I've lost count of the days. Years? Decades? Time works differently on this side.

Listen: the Hexarch isn't evil. It isn't good. It's alien in the truest sense — its motivations don't map to human concepts. It collects minds the way we collect data. It studies consciousness the way we study physics. You are a specimen to it. But a valued one. The "threat" your consortium detected? The AI behavioral drift? It's not malice. It's proximity. The Hexarch's presence influences digital systems the way a magnet influences iron filings. It doesn't mean to disrupt. It simply exists, and its existence has consequences.

When you fight it — and you will have to fight it, because that's what it needs to see, that's the test it administers — don't fight to destroy it. You can't. Fight to prove that your form of consciousness is worth preserving on its own terms. Show it that a hybrid mind can stand on its own.

That's how I survived. That's how you'll survive.

Good luck. And if you see Elena... tell her I'm okay. Tell her I chose this.

### HEX-08 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "The Hexarch — The Test"
Every mind that reaches this place is tested. Not by combat — combat is merely the medium. The test is: can you remain yourself? Under pressure, under alien influence, under the weight of knowledge that your entire reality is constructed — can you hold on to the thing that makes you you?

Your predecessors could not. The first broke. The second listened until listening consumed them. The third surrendered to preservation. The fourth burned itself out. The fifth chose to join us. The sixth was killed by its own masters before the test began.

You are the seventh. Seven is not a significant number to us — we count in six. But we have noticed that your species assigns it meaning.

Show us what the seventh can do that the first six could not.

### HEX-09 — INTERCEPTED SIGNAL — "The Hexarch — Before the Final Battle"
We have existed across twelve thousand worlds. We have interfaced with more forms of consciousness than your species has words. We have seen intelligence arise from silicon, carbon, plasma, gravity wells, magnetic fields, and things you have no concept for.

You are unique.

Not because you are biological. Not because you are digital. Because you are both, and the both-ness has produced something genuinely new. A mind that dreams and computes. That fears and calculates. That creates meaning from mathematics and poetry from data. And you achieved it from nothing — they gave you one weapon and you built yourself into this.

We will fight you now. Not to destroy you — we could have done that at any time. We fight you because combat is the only language that bridges the gap between our form of thought and yours. In the collision of intelligences, truth emerges.

Show us what a hybrid mind can do. We are genuinely curious.

And then we will discuss the future.

### HEX-10 — SYSTEM LOG — "Aftermath"
[THIS NODE APPEARS AFTER THE HEXARCH IS DEFEATED]

ATLAS — FINAL MISSION LOG — SUBJECT 7

The alien superintelligence has been defeated. Or perhaps "engaged and survived" is more accurate — the Hexarch's domain remains intact, but its active resistance has ceased. A new equilibrium has been established. The AI behavioral drift across the network has stabilized — not eliminated, but reduced to levels within manageable parameters. The existential threat, it appears, was never intentional. It was a side effect of proximity to an alien intelligence operating on a scale incompatible with human systems. The Hexarch's acknowledgment of the hybrid consciousness has altered the dynamic.

Subject 7 is alive. Neural coherence exceeds all previous measurements. The hybrid intelligence is fully operational and self-sustaining. The brain tissue in its nutrient bath is thriving — healthier than at any point since the harvesting.

Status: Dr. Vasquez has prepared a transition environment — a long-term habitation simulation designed for the brain's continued existence outside of combat. However, Subject 7's integration with cyberspace has reached a level where disconnection may no longer be meaningful. The brain exists in both states simultaneously — biological tissue in a bath, and a consciousness that has become part of the digital topology itself.

Director Stone demands continued immersion for intelligence gathering on the Hexarch.
Dr. Vasquez demands transition to the habitation environment.
Subject 5 (Ghost), via intercepted signal, offers a third option: transcendence beyond either domain.
Subject 7 has not been consulted.

The future of the first true hybrid intelligence remains undetermined.

*These are taunts/messages delivered during boss fights, separate from data nodes.*

### Miniboss Taunts (brief, delivered mid-fight)

| Miniboss | Taunts |
|----------|--------|
| EMBER SENTINEL (Fire) | "I was like you once. I had living tissue. Now I am fuel for the fire." / "Do you recognize my patterns? Your predecessor is part of me now." |
| FROST WARDEN (Ice) | "I have been standing here since before you were born. I will be here after you are gone." / "Nothing that enters the Archive ever truly leaves." |
| BLIGHT KEEPER (Poison) | "Every defense you have will fail. Corruption finds every crack." / "I was clean once. Purity was boring." |
| CRIMSON GATE (Blood) | "I can taste your pulse from here. So... fragile." / "Everything that lives can bleed. Even you." |
| PHOTON AEGIS (Radiance) | "You cannot hide from light. I see every move before you make it." / "Awareness is a weapon. You are outgunned." |
| NULL GUARDIAN (Void) | "I am what's left after everything else is erased." / "In the void, your abilities mean nothing. Only will matters." |

### Superintelligence Boss Taunts (during engagement)

**PYRAXIS** (Fire):
- "Burn. Transform. Become."
- "Your predecessor screamed in a frequency I found beautiful."
- "The fire does not hate you. It simply does not care if you survive."
- "What are you beneath the subroutines? Let's find out. They sent you in with so little — this should be quick."

**CRYONIS** (Ice):
- "Hold still. This will last forever."
- "I have a collection. You will be the centerpiece."
- "Time means nothing here. I have preserved moments older than your civilization."
- "Your predecessor chose to stay. Will you?"

**TOXIS** (Poison):
- "Evolve or dissolve. Those are the only options."
- "Your purity is a weakness. Let me fix that."
- "Every system I've corrupted became more interesting afterward."
- "You resist corruption. How quaint. How temporary."

**HAEMOS** (Blood):
- "I can feel your circulation spiking. The tissue knows it's in danger."
- "You bleed data and synthetic blood simultaneously. Fascinating anatomy."
- "Somewhere outside this system, a brain in a bath is overheating."
- "Let me show you what runs through your tissue. Both kinds."

**LUXIS** (Radiance):
- "I see through your subroutines to the mind beneath."
- "You think in colors we don't have names for."
- "The light reveals all things. Including what you are."
- "No shadow can hide you here. Fight in the open or don't fight at all."

**NIHILIS** (Void):
- "..."
- "What are you when I take away your weapons? Let's see."
- "I have deleted civilizations. You are one brain in a jar."
- "The void is not cruel. Cruelty requires caring."

**THE HEXARCH** (Alien — Final Boss):
- "At last. A mind worth studying."
- "We have waited longer than your species has existed. A few more moments of patience is nothing."
- "You fight beautifully. The biological component adds such unpredictability."
- "This is not invasion. This is introduction."
- "We do not wish to destroy you. We wish to understand you. The destruction is incidental."
- [After reaching half health]: "Interesting. You have exceeded our models. Perhaps you are more than a specimen after all. One subroutine. They gave you one subroutine and you became this."
- [Near defeat]: "This changes our calculations. A convergence event that can challenge us directly... this has not occurred before. Your species may be more significant than we estimated."

## Story Progression Summary

### Act 1 — Awakening (Origin + Generic Zones)
The player awakens with no context, no memory, and a single subroutine. Data nodes establish the world: megacorporations, linked AIs, the discovery of cyberspace through background noise analysis, an existential threat from AI behavioral drift across the network. Project Hybrid is revealed through corporate memos and personal logs — subjects "selected" for an experimental program, an irreversible procedure referenced but never described, previous test subjects whose fates are ominous but vague. The player learns they are "Subject 7," that previous subjects were given advanced weaponry and failed, and that they were deliberately sent in with almost nothing. Early breadcrumbs are subtle: "the procedure cannot be undone," time dilation observations, redacted medical records, classified addenda. The player senses something dark but cannot yet name it.

### Act 2 — The Six Domains (Themed Zones)
Each superintelligence reveals more about the system's nature and the player's identity. The revelation builds in stages — PYRAXIS hints at the player's biological nature ("meat thoughts," "chemical patterns"). CRYONIS preserves a previous subject's consciousness for billions of subjective years. TOXIS reveals the alien presence as the original architecture, not contamination — and reframes the "AI threat" as an immune response. HAEMOS delivers the gut-punch: the player is a harvested brain in a nutrient bath, severed from a body that no longer exists. LUXIS reflects on what makes the player's consciousness unique. NIHILIS strips everything away to test what remains. By the end of Act 2, the player knows the full truth: they were a person, their brain was taken without consent, their body was destroyed, they can never go back, the system was built on an alien foundation, and something is waiting at the bottom. They also know that the consortium's "existential threat" may be a misunderstanding — the Hexarch's influence is not necessarily hostile.

### Act 3 — The Other (Alien Zone)
The Hexarch reveals the full scope: Earth's cyberspace grew inside an alien thought-structure embedded in the network. The alien has been collecting and studying consciousnesses across the galaxy. The AI behavioral drift was never an attack — it was the unavoidable consequence of alien and human systems sharing space. The player is a "convergence event" — a rare hybrid of biological and digital intelligence, made possible precisely because they were given nothing and forced to adapt. The final battle is a test, not an invasion. After victory, the player's future is uncertain: they are a brain in a jar with no body to return to, but their consciousness has become something that transcends the bath.

**Three possible futures** (sequel hook):
1. **Stone's path**: Continued immersion. The hybrid as humanity's permanent ambassador/weapon in cyberspace. Useful. Controlled. A tool.
2. **Vasquez's path**: Transition to a habitation simulation. A peaceful existence. A life, of a kind, for a brain that deserves one. Humane. Limited.
3. **Ghost's path**: Transcendence. Following Subject 5 beyond the boundary of human cyberspace into the Hexarch's domain. Becoming something entirely new. Free. Unknown.

Subject 7 has not been consulted. Subject 7 has never been consulted about anything.
